In the doorway stands his mother, with her hands on her hips and an angry expression on her face. The room is in disarray: clothes are thrown on the bed, empty soda cans are on a small table, several toys are behind a white chair, and books are scattered under the bed. On the wall, a picture hangs between a window and a clock.",
